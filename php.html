- Point 2 reviewed.

...

- Point 14 reviewed.


Checklist for Review
Type Hinting and Return Types
Ensure all functions use appropriate type hinting and return types for better readability and debugging.
Example:


Constants for Magic Numbers
Replace magic numbers with named constants to improve code maintainability.
Example:
$amount = round($amount, 2);  // Avoid
$amount = round($amount, CommonUtil::DECIMAL_POINTS);  // Preferred

Transaction Handling for Multiple Table Operations this will applicable for new development
Use try/catch blocks for transaction handling when multiple tables are involved.
For large datasets, ensure checks for deadlocks or long waits in query execution.
Code Formatting
Adhere to a maximum of 100–120 characters per line and 100–120 lines per function.
Maintain proper indentation and spacing for better readability.
Configurability and Extensibility
If a new setting changes the behavior of an existing flow, ensure it is implemented as a trait or plugin for configurability.
Consistent API Resource Structure
Maintain a consistent structure for API resources.
Even if some columns are not required, define them as null to ensure uniformity.
Example:
json
CopyEdit
"paymentInfo": { "id": 111,"amount": 222,"customFunctionalityData": null}
Code Reusability
Avoid using overly broad functions that fetch unnecessary data.
Break large functions into smaller, reusable ones for modularity.
Avoid queries inside loops; instead, prefetch data and use key-value pairs for efficient lookups.
Migration Guidelines
Do not rename incorrect class or file names (e.g., Cdnote.php to CDNote.php).
Method names can be updated if camelCase conventions are not followed.
Functional Test Cases
Ensure all functional test cases have been executed and validated.
Functionality Verification
Confirm that the functionality is working as expected and should be able to find the area which has been impacted as well.
Code Comments and Annotations
Include meaningful comments and annotations in the code for better understanding.
Backward Compatibility
Validate that the code is backward-compatible with existing systems.
UI Code Review
Check for UI issues, such as proper button states and JavaScript validations.
Unit Test Cases
Ensure unit tests are reviewed and committed for all new features. (Applicable for Laravel projects.)
PSR Standards
Verify adherence to PSR (PHP Standards Recommendations).

Checklist for Review
Transaction Handling for Multiple Table Operations
Ensure proper transaction handling and checks for deadlocks in large dataset operations.
Query Review
Use indexes for all queries, and check performance using the EXPLAIN keyword.
Avoid duplicate indexes; ensure foreign and unique keys are created where necessary.
Construct role-based queries for optimized performance.
Example:
Admin: Fetch all active entries.
Zone Manager: Fetch entries under specific areas.
Migration Guidelines
Follow naming conventions.
Do not rename classes or files incorrectly.
Update method names if camelCase is not adhered to.
Recursive Issues in CakePHP
Add recursive = -1 in queries to avoid unnecessary data fetching in associations.
Example:
findById(1, ['name'], null, -1);
Architectural Flow and Backward Compatibility
Ensure all changes align with Bizom standards.
Validate database table structures and core module compatibility.
MySQL Query Guidelines
Avoid queries in loops.
Limit the use of IN queries where possible.
Test complex queries on large databases and include explanations in comments.
Revision Queries
Ensure queries are re-runnable and handle updates gracefully.
PSR Standards
Verify adherence to PSR (PHP Standards Recommendations).
Unit Test Cases
Ensure unit tests are reviewed and committed for all new features. (Applicable for Laravel projects.)

These guidelines aim to ensure comprehensive code reviews, maintain coding standards, and prevent potential issues in production systems.
